## Dataset

> In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Ford GoBike, a bike-share system provider.
> The dataset used for this exploratory analysis by joining multiple data files consists of monthly individual trip data from Jan 2018 to May 2019.
Features of this dataset:
User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or “Customer” = Casual)
Trip Duration(in seconds)
Bike ID
Start Time and Date
End Time and Date
Start Station ID
End Station ID
Start Station Name
End Station Name
End Station Latitude
End Station Longitude
Start Station Latitude
Start Station Longitude
Questions to be answered:
How trip duration has been affected by (Weather, Day, user type)
what is the monthly, daily and hourly trend per user Type
What is the percentage of user type (subscriber or a customer)?


## Summary of Findings 

>In this investigation, I wanted to find out what are the factors that has an affect on trip duration. It turns out that the weather affect on trip duration is very limited, since the weather in SF does not vary that much. User type has a bigger effect since subscribers tend to rent the bikes for longer trips.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>Usage patternes between subscribers and customers are seen from the exploration:
> - Subscribers usage is concentrated in the workdays for commute and custommers use the system for relaxation after work and on the weekend.
>- Customer trip duration is around 30 minutes while most subscribers trips take around 12 minutes in average. Although subscribers are more than customers, we can see that customer rides longer than subscriber.
> - Subscribers usage is comparable during the week while it gose down on the weekend whereas customers ride a lot on weekends.
> - Obviously, the rush hours has an impact where many subscribers' trips concentrated at 8am and 5pm on work days.
> - Customers trips concentrated between 11am and 2pm on the weekend, yet they use the system after 5pm on work days.
